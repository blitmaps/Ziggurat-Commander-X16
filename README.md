# Ziggurat-Commander-X16
Block puzzle game for the Commander X16 (built for Rev-31 of the emulator)

I plan to rebuild it with register changes when a more finished version of the system is ready.  The registers were changing often, so It was a moving target.

Please note - the code is very very rubbish, I was messing about with trying to use the C64 c-compiler.
